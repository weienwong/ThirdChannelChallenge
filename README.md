# Third Channel Code Submission

## I have completed the following Coding Dojo Katas in Python. I have tested this using Python 2.7 and Python 3

### 1.Fizz Buzz Stages 1 and 2 (http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)
### 2.Roman Numerals Part 1 (http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/) 

## **Get the code**

```
git clone https://github.com/weienwong/ThirdChannelChallenge.git
```

## **Requirements**
### You will need to have Python 2.7 or Python 3 installed on your system

### How to run code from from command line

#### To run the main solution to the fizz buzz problem, execute the following command
```
python fizz_buzz.py
```
#### To run the test suite to the fizz buzz problem, execute the following command
```
python test_fizz_buzz.py
```

#### There was no description / requirement in the Roman Numerals Kata to run the code from the solution file, so the only way to invoke the function is through using the tests.

#### To run the test suite for the roman numerals problem, execute the following command
```
python test_roman_numerals.py
```

## **Test cases**
### For the FizzBuzz problem I tested for the following cases

- numbers divisible by 3
- numbers divisible by 5
- numbers divisible by 3 and 5
- numbers that contain the digit 3 and is divisible by 3
- numbers that contain the digit 3 but is not divisible by 3
- numbers that contain the digit 5 and is divisible by 5
- numbers that contain the digit 5 but is not divisible by 5
- numbers that are neither divisible by 3 or 5, nor do they contain the digits 3 or 5

### For the Roman numerals problem I tested for the following cases

- numbers that contain the digit 4 and 9
- numbers that are less that a numeral character by 1 character (ex. numbers like 90, 400, 900 etc.)
- large numbers that contain multiple digits (ex. 2751)
